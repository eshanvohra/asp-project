                Our Story
            </h1>

                of our customers. We strive hard every day to deliver value

            <h1>Our Vision & Mission</h1>
            <br />

            <br />

            <h1>Our Values</h1>

            <h1>Corporate Identity</h1>
            <p>We are ESmartBanker, and since inception, 
                our sole purpose has been to make every Indian prosperous, 
                bringing about a positive difference and improving the lives of the urban unserved!
<p>We strive hard to undertake various activities to deepen the understanding of the various challenges to financial inclusion, addressing policy issues via education, skill development, community connectivity, and financial advisory initiatives, and so on.

Our values and vision, and our beliefs that drive ESmartBanker are reflected in our corporate identity as well.</p>

            <br />
            <p>The logo also amplifies the Brand Promise of ESmartBanker, captured in the statement ‘Likho Apni Kahani’ or ‘Write Your Destiny’.</p>
<p>The logo is relevant to all the customer segments that the bank targets: the underserved,
    as well as those who are financially healthier. The lines also reflect the spirit of the
    company in another manner: no line can ever be drawn without effort and initiative by individuals,
    to walk their individual journeys or make the connections between people.</p>
            <p>The lines are, therefore, visual extensions of the handwritten stories of real people
                impacted by the work of ESmartBanker, and of the networks of connections
                being enabled by ESmartBanker. Derived from stories and connections, they
                form the graphic element for all communication.</p>
